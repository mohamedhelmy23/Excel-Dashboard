Interactive Dashboards:
Multiple filters based on marital status, occupation, region, education, and number of children.
Ability to filter data by different categories to observe their impact on purchasing decisions.
Analysis & Visualizations:
Income analysis by gender and its relationship to bicycle purchases.
Number of bicycles purchased across different age groups.
Daily commuting distance analysis and its effect on the decision to buy a bicycle.
Additional Features:
Clear and simplified data presentation for better understanding.
Interactive filters to analyze information from multiple perspectives.
Project Goal
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analytical tool to help understand the factors influencing bicycle purchases. It enables businesses and decision-makers to optimize marketing strategies and make data-driven decisions. ðŸš€
